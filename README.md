# algebraic progression quadratic formula

python script to calculate the maxima of a, b and c of the curve function `(b*c)^(a/2-0.5)` and search domain `b^2-4*a*c>=0 and 0<=a<=var_limit and 0<=b<=var_limit and 0<=c<=var_limit`

used for the incremental game [algebraic progression](https://randomtuba.github.io/Algebraic-Progression/)


if too lazy, a and b always max, c is `floor(a/4)` such as `a = 12, b = 12, c = 3` or `a = 17, b = 17, c = 4`
